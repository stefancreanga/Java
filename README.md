1. Password Generator and Strength Checker

This program generates a password based upon select criteria (uppercase, lowercase, repetition, special characters, etc.) and it also uses the pwnedpasswords API to check if a passwords has been breached.
In addition to that, it also allows to check manually if a password fulfills the criteria above.

It also uses JavaFX for a slightly better interface.
